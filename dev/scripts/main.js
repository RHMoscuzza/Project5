Our madam archdeacon is at the center of it all, and if the rumors are true, no vestment can hide her guilt from the likes of us. The service is about to start. The organ hums to life, signalling the start of the processional: the venerable queen is about to emerge. Suspicion thickens the air like pollen. Our faces turn towards the narthex, primed to sting. Conditions are favorable for swarming.";

// Notes on developer:
// Use double quotes
// Function style: Function expression (var function = () {})
// ES6 best practices

// PSEUDOCODE:
// Input field where users input name of a movie (required)
// (if no movie exists / can be found - do something - but we will have autocomplete to avoid this problem)
// On submit: Searches the IMDB database for movies with the same title
// Also look at the genres that the movie title is associated with
// Return list of X (4) desired books
// Connect to a book API (Google Books) to determine length of book (depends on API data)
// Also display a paragraph (of 100 words) for user to time themselves reading
// Timer on the designated paragraph. User can hit start to begin, and then stop once they finish reading it.
// When click on start, timer starts (visible to user)
// Option to reset timer
// When click stop, timer stops - we store the number into a variable: UserTime.
// Reading Speed: Measured in words per minute. Function: ReadingSPeed to Take number of words and divide by UserTime
// Display Reading Speed: eading speed is displayed.

// Input field: "How much time will you spend reading each day?" User inputs a number
// Take that value and store it in a variable: UserFreeTime

// Calculate how long it takes to read the book based on UserFreeTime and ReadingSpeed


// readingSpeed = Words / minute
// bookAvg = 250 words / page
// totalPages = x pages / book (in pages)

// using math, determine:
// totalWords = totalPages * bookAvg (in words)

// totalTimeToRead = totalWords / readingSpeed (in time)

// freeTimePerDay = minutes

// total days totalTimeToRead / freeTimePerDay

// A paragraph is displayed to the user that shows the results
// Also included is an average result (so user can compare their results to the average person)
// (Disclaimer: Numbers may be slightly inaccurate)
