Reading Speed: Measured in words per minute. Function: ReadingSPeed to Take number of words and divide by UserTime
Display Reading Speed: reading speed is displayed.

Input field: "How much time will you spend reading each day?" User inputs a number
Take that value and store it in a variable: UserFreeTime

Calculate how long it takes to read the book based on UserFreeTime and ReadingSpeed


readingSpeed = Words / minute
bookAvg = 250 words / page
totalPages = x pages / book (in pages)

using math, determine:
totalWords = totalPages * bookAvg (in words)

totalTimeToRead = totalWords / readingSpeed (in time)

freeTimePerDay = minutes

total days totalTimeToRead / freeTimePerDay

A paragraph is displayed to the user that shows the results
Also included is an average result (so user can compare their results to the average person)
